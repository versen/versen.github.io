📅 **Date**: October 23, 2025
📍 **Venue**: Radboud University, Nijmegen
👥 **Audience**: "Junior" academics (final-year PhD candidates, postdocs, and assistant professors)

Securing research funding is a crucial step in building a successful academic career; however, navigating the complex landscape of opportunities in Software Engineering (SE) can be challenging. This event brings together experienced researchers and funding experts to provide insights, share lessons learned, and offer practical guidance on establishing and sustaining collaborations with academia and industry.

Through keynote talks, small-group mentoring, and networking, participants will learn valuable tips and strategies for developing successful grant proposals and managing collaborative projects.

What you need to know about NWO, before you start writing your project application

> In this presentation, I will give my view on what you can do to increase your chances of success when submitting proposals to NWO. The presentation will be based on my own experiences, both as proposal writer and as NWO panel member.

"Show me the money!", said the promotion committee to the tenure-tracker

> Research funding is an indispensable part of academic life and often the bane of tenure-trackers’ existence. The scope of this talk covers European-level, collaborative research projects through both Horizon programs, as well as ITEA which is rather popular in Software Engineering research. I will discuss my own meandering path towards obtaining grants and share some tips and pitfalls along the way.
