## VERSEN Thesis Awards - Call for Submissions

<!-- {% include alert.html type="warning" msg="The call of the 2021 Thesis Awards has closed and the results will be announced in due time." %} -->

### Submission

The submission procedure is lightweight. You should submit the thesis and the candidate’s CV (both in PDF). Optionally, nominations can be complemented by a letter by the supervisors (PDF) and an accompanying short video (new this year, see below). 

Submissions should be sent via the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccH-a5gcNj-VEIK6jlmUGRz_IEB2JSAdEEIDQCFz3Jsd82Gw/viewform).

For the selection criteria, please refer to the [procedure](/contents/procedure-thesis-award).

For further information about the awards, contact dr.ing. Anton Wijs ([A.J.Wijs@tue.nl](mailto:A.J.Wijs@tue.nl)).

#### **New this year: Video nomination!**

The nominee, the supervisor, or both are given the option of submitting a short video (up to 3 minutes long) that presents the thesis (methods, achievements, lessons, significance) in a clear and engaging manner, ideally targeting broad audiences. 

Submitting this video is optional; a link to the video can be provided in the submission form. 

We look for creative videos that highlight the impact of software engineering at large. Depending on the number and quality of submitted videos, we will organize a session at the award ceremony with the best video(s).
