## Working Group: Life-Long Learning

The goal of the Life-Long Learning working group is to investigate the needs of Software Engineers for education at the post-Master level, and how VERSEN can play a role in providing that education. Some current examples of post-Master education are the PDEng programs offered by the Dutch universities of Technology, and part-time programs aimed at professionals working in industry.
