VERSEN grew out of the open meetings at the end of the yearly [SEN symposium](/contents/works/symposium) in 2014 and 2016.

The initiators of VERSEN were:

* Jurgen Vinju 
* Frank de Boer
* Sjaak Brinkkemper

We initiated VERSEN with the permission and support of everybody who was present at the SEN symposium in January 2016. The VERSEN board was then given shape by inviting practically all software professors in The Netherlands to its board. Everybody accepted.

VERSEN was funded via the budget of the software "societal theme" at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica.
