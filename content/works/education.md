## Working Group: Education

Many members develop, teach, and revise courses in Software Engineering for their universities on a regular basis. Educating our students in core software engineering principles is most important for addressing the urgent societal need for people with expertise in developing high-quality software.

The goal of this working group is to explore how software engineering education can be improved across all levels. We start by making an inventory of CS curricula across the country, focusing on the software engineering parts. From this overview similarities and differences can be compiled, and collaboration at the course level can be fostered (e.g. by sharing best practices in software engineering education).

## Statements

The Education WG is made up of passionate educators who are eager to share their views and experiences with others. If you would like to get a better sense of our group's perspectives, we encourage you to read through the statements from our members.
