## Working Group: Master's Thesis Projects

Many VERSEN members supervise master thesis students. Often these students do a project in collaboration with a company. For students, it can be challenging to find a project of their interest in a good company, and it could help them if we can provide them with an overview of suitable companies that they could look at for potential thesis projects.

However, universities also all have their own way of working, and have certain companies that they have already have relationships with. This working group will try to get an overview of how master students get connected with companies in the different VERSEN partners, and if suitable, it will then come with a proposal to provide a national platform to connect master students to companies.

If you would like to collaborate with members of VERSEN in the form of a master thesis project, see our [call for participation](/contents/works/masters-thesis-projects-call-for-participation) on master thesis collaboration between companies and universities.
