## Working Group: Community Events

This working group aims to organize regular opportunities for the VERSEN community to get together beyond the established events like the annual SEN symposium and tracks at ICT.OPEN. For this, it seeks to collaborate with other organizations from the Dutch software engineering research landscape, such as the Dutch research schools IPA, SIKS and ASCI, the ICT Research Platform Nederland (IPN), and the NIRICT Institute of the 4TU.Federation.

The working group has also set up an [OSF page](https://osf.io/mg29a/) to collect material (presentation slides and the like) from our events.

An updated list of current and past events can be found [here](/contents/events).
