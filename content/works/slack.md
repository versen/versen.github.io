## Working Group: Slack

{% include alert.html type="warning" msg="This working group has been archived." %}

The goal of the working group is to boost the participation of community members in Slack by adding content, triggering discussions, and scouting new members to be invited.

The [VERSEN Slack space](slack://app?team=versen) aims to tie together software engineering researchers in the Netherlands in an informal, peer-to-peer manner, via a quick communication medium that complements the website and the mailing list. Through the VERSEN Slack space, researchers can share job opportunities, advertise their events including graduations, seek for help or collaborators, or "just" socialize in an environment that connects the whole VERSEN community.
