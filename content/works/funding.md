## Working Group: Funding

VERSEN has a yearly budget to be spent on actions that support its mission. Next to the board, members of VERSEN may request funding for particular projects (most likely events) which are in line with this mission.

The goal of this working group is to accept funding proposals and review them,
then advise the [Executive Board](/works/executive-board) on which proposals to fund and which not, and finally to
communicate decisions and feedback to the proposers.

VERSEN also document the procedures for funding requests and help keep them transparent and consistent, or at least well-motivated. The relevant information is available and maintained in the [Requests for funding HOWTO](/assets/pdf/funding-v1.1.pdf). We can be contacted at mailto:funding@version.nl, as described in that document.
