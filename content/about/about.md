## About VERSEN

VERSEN is the Dutch National Association for Software Engineering. Its mission is to bring together researchers, educators and practitioners in the field of software engineering in The Netherlands, who share the common goals of advancing the field of software engineering, raising public awareness of the challenges and opportunities of the field, acquiring funding for groundbreaking and applied research, transferring academic results to society, and representing software engineers to professional, legal, and political entities. These goals and aspirations are compiled together with the challenges and research landscape in the [Manifesto on Software Research and Education](/contents/manifesto) in the Netherlands, written by VERSEN.

The Netherlands has a great international reputation in the field of Software Engineering which stems from both the early and continued achievements in Computer Science and Software Engineering research, and the early adoption and continued leadership in the industry (administrative systems, high-tech, creative industry).

## Organization

* VERSEN is an informal and flat organization with a relatively large board and a large group of members. Members are from different institutes, universities, companies, and other organizations, who share a common responsibility and enthusiasm for the field of software engineering and the drive to improve it.
* CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) is the administrative home of VERSEN.
* VERSEN organizes the yearly SEN symposium
* VERSEN meets regularly to evaluate past actions and make plans for the future.
* [VERSEN Working Groups](/contents/works) are our way of effectively working together towards a specific goal.
