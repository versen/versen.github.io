Jan Martens is defending his PhD thesis at Eindhoven University of Technology on September 25 at 16:00 hours. 

The thesis entitled the complexity of determining bisimulation provides a.o. new parallel algorithms for (branching) bisimulation, provides lowerbounds to determine bisimulation both sequentially and in parallel, and shows that it is hard to find optimal distinguishing formulas that can be used to explain why certain states are not bisimilar.
