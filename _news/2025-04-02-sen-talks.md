title: "SEN Symposium 2025 - Call for Lightning Talks"
---

The 11th Dutch National Symposium on Software Engineering (SEN) will take place on Friday, 23 May 2025, at CWI Amsterdam.

We invite all software engineering researchers and practitioners in the Netherlands to contribute to the symposium program. We welcome proposals for "lightning talks" - short but engaging presentations, to be allocated between 5 and 10 minutes at the symposium.

There is no specific format for lightning talks. Still, they should be targeting the broad VERSEN audience. An exciting lightning talk may, for instance:
- Describe recently published results;
- Present open research problems (and/or ongoing efforts to tackle them);
- Summarize a recently concluded PhD dissertation;
- Summarize bachelor/master thesis you are working on;
- Recently granted (or started) research projects;
- Motivate a "call to arms" for the broad VERSEN community.


There will be a (lightweight) evaluation of one-page talk proposals (PDF) describing the envisioned presentation at the symposium.

Please submit your one-page proposal (PDF) using [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sensym25).

Important Dates:
- Submission of talk proposals: April 30th, 23:59 (CEST).
- Notification: May 7th.

We look forward to seeing you at the SEN symposium!
