As you know the VERSEN community is organized in Working Groups. Some of them are temporary and some of them are permanent. They each have a specific goal and a manageable number of members that collaborate towards this goal. Recently the executive board has retired several dormant groups.

Would you like to start a new working group on topic of shared interest? Please do not hesitate to contact us at info@versen.nl! VERSEN is something we build together.
