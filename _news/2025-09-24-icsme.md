title: "Community Achievements at ICSME 2025: Paper and Reviewer Distinctions"
---
 
Two members of our community have been celebrated at the 41st International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2025)!

🙌 Lina Ochoa (Eindhoven University of Technology), together with : Corentin Latappy, Thomas Degueule, Jean-Rémy Falleri, and Romain Robbes from LaBRI, Bordeaux, won a Distinguished Paper Award. Out of 146 submissions, only 45 papers were accepted, and just four received this honor. Their paper, “Roseau: Fast, Accurate, Source-based Breaking Change Analysis in Java”, presents Roseau, a new tool that makes it faster and more accurate to detect breaking changes in Java libraries. Roseau outperforms existing tools, works on both source and bytecode, and makes large-scale studies possible in minutes rather than days.

👏 Alexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven University of Technology) received a Distinguished Reviewer Award, given to only 10 of the 102 program committee members, for providing thoughtful, timely, and high-quality reviews.

Big congratulations to Lina and Alexander — a fantastic achievement for Dutch software engineering research! 🎊
