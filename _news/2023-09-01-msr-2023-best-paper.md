The team of researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (Hamid Mohayeji Nasrabadi, Andrei Agaronian, Eleni Constantinou, Nicola Zannone, and Alexander Serebrenik) have won the __ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award__ at the 20th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories ([MSR 2023](https://conf.researchr.org/home/msr-2023)). 

In their award-winning paper "_On the Resolution of Vulnerable Dependencies with Dependabot Security Updates_" Mohayeji et al show that the task of fixing vulnerable dependencies is, to a large extent, delegated to Dependabot and that developers merge the majority of security updates within several days.However, when developers do not merge a security update, they usually address the identified vulnerability manually. This approach, however, often takes up to several months which in turn could expose the projects to security issues.
