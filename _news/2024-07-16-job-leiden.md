Assistant Professor in Automated Reasoning (0.8-1.0 FTE)

The Faculty of Science, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), is seeking candidates for an Assistant Professor (0.8-1.0 FTE) position in Automated Reasoning. 

We seek to appoint an expert in the research area of Combinatorial Optimization, Constraint Solving and Knowledge Representation with applications to Formal Verification, Automatic Synthesis or Automated Reasoning. 

The focus of the position is on the construction and implementation of algorithms for combinatorial problems and the analysis of their practical performance by investigating relations between empirical observations and theoretical results in computational complexity theory. 

In addition, the certification of the correctness of the results computed by algorithms, as well as the explainability of those results, is of interest.
