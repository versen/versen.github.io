title: "New ITEA Grant for the University of Groningen"
---

Prof. Paris Avgeriou of the Software Engineering and Architecture group (SEARCH) of the University of Groningen has acquired a new grant within the ITEA program, entitled Managing Sustainability Tradeoffs (MAST). 

This project will deal with the complex trade-offs between two aspects of sustainability: technical sustainability (and specifically technical debt) and environmental sustainability. 

The group will work with its long-standing partner, Canon Production Printing, alongside 2 Dutch SMEs and partners from Denmark and Portugal. Avgeriou is also the coordinator of the ITEA project and will be joined in this project by Prof. Andrikopoulos. See also [https://itea4.org/project/mast.html](https://itea4.org/project/mast.html)
