[Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor/) will be joining the Formal Methods and Tools group at the University of Twente.  

Fernando's research activity is mainly located within the areas of Software Engineering and Programming Languages and seeks to identify efficient ways to develop software that behaves efficiently. Over the past ten years, his research has focused on the energy efficiency of software systems, in particular, on how exploiting the design diversity of preexisting software components can be an inexpensive way to save energy. Furthermore, he has also been investigating how developers read and understand code and what factors can be taken into account when writing code, so as to make it easier to understand for humans.
