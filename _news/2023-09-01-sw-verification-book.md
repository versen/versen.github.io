The book __Concise Guide to Software Verification: From Model Checking to Annotation Checking__, by Marieke Huisman and Anton Wijs, has recently been published by Springer. The book is primarily meant as a textbook to teach students at the Master level about the whole spectrum of formal methods and techniques that are aimed at verifying correctness of software, and how these techniques can be used in practice. It focuses on techniques whereby the user has some control over the properties that are being checked. It shows a wide range of techniques covering the whole spectrum: from abstract system design to implementation, from bug finding to full proofs, and from techniques that are push-button by design and give a yes/no answer to techniques that require the user to provide explicit guidance to steer the analysis process.
