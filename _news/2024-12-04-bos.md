Dr. Petra van den Bos from the Formal Methods and and Tools group (FMT) has been awarded an M2 grant for the project EVI: Evidence-based black-box checking. The project will be conducted in collaboration with Prof. Frits Vaandrager from Radboud University.  In the project, fundamental questions on automated testing of complex software systems will be tackled. The idea is to develop test automation techniques, that use both information on the expected behaviour of the system, e.g. available from behaviour-driven development of the system, and information about the actual behaviour of the system, e.g. from tests that have already been executed. By combining several sources of evidence, tests are better equipped for detecting software bugs, including those often missed by other tools. The results will be evaluated in industrial case studies.
