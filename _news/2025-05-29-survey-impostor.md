title: "Survey on the Impostor Phenomenon affecting software engineering academics"
---

A team of researchers from Brazil, Canada, Italy, and the Netherlands (Paloma Guenes, Bianca Trinkenreich, Maria Teresa Baldassarre, Alexander Serebrenik, Margaret-Anne Storey and Marcos Kalinowski) is inviting academics in software engineering to participate in a research survey assessing the Impostor Phenomenon. At the end of the survey, you will receive a personalized score based on a validated scale, indicating whether the Impostor Phenomenon may be affecting you. The survey takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.
