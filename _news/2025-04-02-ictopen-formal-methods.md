We are organising the Formal Methods Track at ICT.Open 2025, to take place on 15-16 April 2025 at the Beatrix Theater Jaarbeurs Utrecht.

As you know, ICT.Open is an annual event organized by NWO that brings together not only researchers in all areas of CS, but also industrial partners and policy makers at all levels.

Having an FM track within ICT.Open is therefore a unique opportunity to showcase the strength and diversity of FM research beyond scientific audiences. Our goal is to increase the visibility of FM as a whole, in particular by bringing together talented researchers from all over the Netherlands to present recent advances in the field, to discuss current and future challenges.

The track will consist of a keynote talk on the usage of FM in industry, pitch presentations, posters and demos.

If you are interested in contributing to the FM track, or even if you are simply curious about related events, registration, etc., you can check the ICT.Open website, at https://ictopen.nl/, or contact us: Valentina Castiglioni (v.castiglioni@tue.nl), Jorge PÃ©rez (j.a.perez@rug.nl).
