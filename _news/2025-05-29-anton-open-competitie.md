Many devices and systems are controlled by software. Think of elevators, printers, cars, planes, bridges, and assembly lines in factories. Correct control is often crucial for safety. Supervisory Controller Synthesis is a technique to automatically derive control software, making the software correct by construction. The involved calculations, however, currently limit its applicability. 

In this project, **Michel Reniers** (Associate Professor Mechanical Engineering) and **Anton Wijs** (Associate Professor Mathematics and Computer Science) conduct research on how graphics processors, with an enormous computational power, can be used to scale up this technique, making it possible to generate more complex software in a shorter time span. 

Their proposal received funding from the Open Competition Domain Science-M program for two PhD students and one scientific programmer.
