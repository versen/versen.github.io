The Netherlands Functional Programming Day (or FP Dag) is an annual gathering of researchers, students, and practitioners sharing a common interest in functional programming. The day features talks that cover the latest advances in research, teaching and applications in the area of functional programming and (implementation of) functional languages. Coffee and lunch breaks provide ample opportunity for networking with your colleagues and meeting new people. Experts and newcomers to the field are equally welcome. Colleagues from neighboring countries are more than welcome to attend; the language of the FP Day is English.
