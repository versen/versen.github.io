The Software Engineering and Technology cluster (SET) of the Computer Science Division of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is looking for an assistant professor in social software engineering.

- Social, psychological, emotional, cognitive, and human centric aspects of software development at the levels of individuals, pairs, groups, teams, organizations, or communities;
- Tools and technologies that affect software development groups, organizations, and communities (e.g., Open Source, knowledge-sharing communities, crowdsourcing);
- Issues of leadership, (self-)organization, cooperation, culture, management, socio-technical (in)congruence, stakeholder groups; program comprehension and psychology of programming;
- The role of soft skills (e.g., communication, collaboration, teamwork, organization, negotiation, conflict management) for software engineers;
- Diversity and inclusion in software engineering.

We look for research that both complements and synergizes with that of the current SET research.

This position is part of the Irene Curie fellowship program dedicated to reach at least 30% female researchers among TU/eâ€™s permanent academic staff by 2024 and contributes to the societal goal of promoting equal opportunities and a society in which everyone's abilities are utilized.
