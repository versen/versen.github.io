Daniel Feitosa and Paris Avgeriou, from the University of Groningen, are among the authors of the paper "PairSmell: A Novel Perspective Inspecting Software Modular Structure,‚Äù which received the **Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE 2025**.

The work introduces the concept of **PairSmell**, a new type of architectural smell that detects problematic modular relations between pairs of code entities. By leveraging consensus clustering, the research provides a highly granular approach to identifying architectural design issues. Through a large-scale empirical study on 20 open-source projects, the paper demonstrates the prevalence and impact of PairSmells on software maintainability, and proposes a practical, tool-supported approach to detect and address them.
