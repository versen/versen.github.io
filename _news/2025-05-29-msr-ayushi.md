Dr. Ayushi Rastogi, an Assistant Professor in Software Engineering at the University of Groningen, received the MSR Rich Holt Early Career Achievement Award 2025 at the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories in Ottawa, Canada. This award recognizes early-career researchers who have made outstanding contributions to mining software repositories. 

The award committee wrote that Rastogi's work addresses "prominent research challenges impacting software companies, OSS communities, and society." Her recent work has shown how practitioners' development practices differ from industry and society's expectations (EMSE'24). Another study reports the fairness experiencesÂ of software engineers, as discussed on StackExchange sites (ESEM'24).
