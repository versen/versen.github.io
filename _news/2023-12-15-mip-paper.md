title: "Most Influential Paper Award at International Conference of Software Language Engineering 2023"
---

On 23 October, Tijs van der Storm (CWI and RUG) received the Most Influential Paper Award of the 2023 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) on behalf of a team of 20+ authors, for the paper '_The State of the Art in Language Workbenches_' from 2013. 

The SLE MIP Award distinguishes authors of a paper published at SLE 10 years prior to the award year that has seen the greatest impact in the field of language engineering. The winning paper provides a detailed survey and analysis of language workbenches at the time, both from industry as well as academia. A follow-up journal paper extended the work with a list of future challenges to compare features between language workbenches.
