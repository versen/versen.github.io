title: "Justus Bogner: new Assistant Professor in Software Engineering at VU Amsterdam"
---

Hello everyone, I'm Justus Bogner, a researcher in empirical software engineering from Germany. In August, I started as an Assistant Professor in the [Software and Sustainability (S2)](https://s2group.cs.vu.nl/) group at VU Amsterdam. 
Previously, I was a postdoc for a bit more than 3 years at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, where I led a division of 5 PhD students in Prof. Stefan Wagner’s Empirical Software Engineering group. Before that, i.e., during my PhD and BSc / MSc studies, I worked in industry for more than 9 years as a software engineer at HP, HPE, and DXC Technology, most of it in part-time. During my PhD, which I also received from the University of Stuttgart, I conducted research on the evolvability assurance of microservice-based systems. For my postdoc, I additionally broadened my scope with software engineering for AI-based systems. 

Within software engineering, I’m mostly interested in software architecture and software quality, e.g., maintainability, evolvability, sustainability, and will mainly focus my research on how to achieve these architectural qualities for AI-based systems. Happy to be in the Netherlands and looking forward to meeting many of you in the future!
