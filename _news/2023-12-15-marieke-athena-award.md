The Athena Award is presented by the NWO Domain Science to honour exceptional female researchers, recognizing them as vital role models for others in the scientific community. This year's winners are Marieke Huisman and Prof.Dr. Femke van Wijk.

From the jury report:
Prof. Dr. Marieke Huisman is a professor in Software Reliability and chair of the Computer Science department at the University of Twente. Her research is focused on the reliability and correctness of concurrent and distributed software.

Professor Huisman has been an inspirational role model for generations of students and colleagues in Computer Sciences, a field in which representation by women is scarce. Next to her outstanding research activities, the committee admires the positive changes prof. Huisman established as institute director and chair of the ambassador network regarding work-life balance, equal opportunities for women, and diversity and inclusion at conferences. Furthermore, the committee praises her efforts in the field to attract more girls in computer sciences. The event ‘Alice & Eve, a celebration of women in computing’ that she co-created is a good example of these efforts.
