Peter Lammich from the FMT group of UTwente has been granted an NWO M1 grant for researching Verification of Efficient and Secure Parallel Algorithms. The research will explore stepwise refinement methods in combination with interactive theorem provers to develop verification techniques that scale to efficient implementations of complex parallel algorithms.
