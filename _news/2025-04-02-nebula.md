title: "VU Amsterdam pilots its own platform for open generative AI models"
---

The Network Institute at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has launched a new platform called Nebula. This platform makes it easy for VU researchers to use advanced language models (LLMs) without relying on commercial providers. In total, more than 1,500 open AI models are available, with six models already running, including Deepseek, Llama, and Qwen.

Why is this important? AI models are typically hosted by large tech companies outside Europe, which means less control over data and potential privacy risks. Nebula is fully hosted within VU Amsterdam, allowing researchers to maintain full control over the models they use and their data. This ensures greater transparency and compliance with European regulations.
