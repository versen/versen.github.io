Jacob Krüger (Eindhoven University of Technology, Software Engineering and Technology cluster) has received a 2024 NWO Veni grant in the domain Science (ENW).

Through his project "Conceptualizing human assumptions in software evolution (CHASE)", he will study how developers make assumptions to solve tasks for which they lack knowledge. Such assumptions may be wrong and cause severe defects, but there is no research on how developers make assumptions while software evolves or how particularly wrong or outdated assumptions can be identified. The project aims to develop a first theory on how developers make assumptions about the software they work on, integrating social and psychological components.
