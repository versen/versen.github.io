 Hallo, I am [Khawlah Al-shubati](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/khawlahAlshubati), thrilled to join VU Amsterdam as a PhD researcher within the [INNOGUARD project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101169233), where I focus on sustainability modeling of Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems. 

 My journey began with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering and continued with a Master's in Computer Engineering at Eastern Mediterranean University, where I researched hybrid optimization using reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. Along the way, I’ve worked as a research and teaching assistant for various software engineering and AI courses, gained experiences in software engineering, data engineering, project management and machine learning. I’m excited to contribute to the VU S2 research community and grow through collaboration and innovation.
