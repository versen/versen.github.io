Petra van den Bos and Marielle Stoelinga received the __Best Artefact Award at FORTE2023__. The artefact is associated with the paper "__With a Little Help from Your Friends: Semi-cooperative Games via Joker Moves__". 

The paper combines the research fields of game theory and software testing: strategies for Joker games are translated to executable test cases. In the Joker game, Player 1 (the Tester) gets help from Player 2 (the System Under Test) by playing a Joker. This way, goal states can be reached, while Player 1 has no full control. In test execution, a goal state is reached, because the test case makes use of any  help offered by the System Under Test. This way, we use that, usually, a System Under Test is not strictly adversarial, while this is a common assumption in game theory. The artefact implements the Joker games, test case generation, and allows reproducing experimental results for case studies.
