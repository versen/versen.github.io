title: "Financial support from VERSEN: reminder"
---

VERSEN has a yearly budget to be spent on activities that support its mission.  If you are organizing such an activity, you can ask for some financial support (typically an amount between €500 and €2500). 

To this end the VERSEN Executive Board has established a working group that will accept funding proposals and review them, then advise the Executive Board on which proposals to fund and which not, also communicate decisions and feedback to the proposers. 

Is this something fro you? Please check the information about funding requests here: [https://www.versen.nl/assets/pdf/funding-v1.1.pdf](https://www.versen.nl/assets/pdf/funding-v1.1.pdf)  

Start by contacting the VERSEN Funding Working Group to pitch your idea, and get feedback and suggestions (funding@versen.nl)
