[Milan Lopuhaä-Zwakenberg](https://people.utwente.nl/m.a.lopuhaa) is appointed as assistant professor at the Formal Methods & Tools group at the University of Twente. His research focuses on the mathematical properties of metrics for safety, security, and privacy. His most recent work includes algebra-based algorithms for calculating attack tree and fault tree metrics, and privacy-preserving algorithms for distributed optimization. Previously, he worked as a postdoc in differential privacy at TU Eindhoven, and as a PhD student in arithmetic geometry at Radboud University Nijmegen.
