We are excited to announce several opportunities for contributing to the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA 2026), the premier conference for software architecture. The conference will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands, from June 22-26, 2026. 

This is to inform you that all tracks are open for submission, see them [here](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2026) 

Notice that this year we also have the new [SA showcase track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icsa-2026/icsa-2026-software-architecture-showcase), which is meant for presenting SA-related datasets, benchmarks, and tools. This should be particularly attractive for empirical SE researchers, companies, and tool developers, spread the voice!  

We look forward to your contributions and hope to see you in Amsterdam!

Best regards,
The ICSA 2026 Organizing Committee
