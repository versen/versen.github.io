---

Hello! My name is [Klervie Toczé](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klervietocze/). I have recently joined the Software and Sustainability group at VU Amsterdam as a postdoc researcher. I will work on the FEED4FOOD EU project, which deals with sustainable urban agriculture, together with Professor Patricia Lago and Associate Professor Lia van Wesenbeeck from the School of Business and Economics. The aim is to create a dashboard for following different KPIs based on data collected in four Living Labs. 

I recently completed my PhD at Linköping University (Sweden), which dealt with resource management in edge computing. The title of my thesis is "Orchestrating a Resource-aware Edge". 

I am looking forward to meeting many of you in the future!
