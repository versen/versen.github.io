title: "New publication on reusing ontologies in software development"
---

Reusing ontologies effectively is a key challenge and an architectural decision in knowledge-intensive software development, particularly in the field of systems engineering. 

This latest research introduces the Onto4Reuse Framework, designed to tackle this issue by making ontology reuse more efficient and practical for software engineers.

In the paper, the authors propose the combination of innovative approaches, such as:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Ontology Design Patterns

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ontology Matching with Foundational Ontologies

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse Engineering for Grounding Operational Ontologies

4Ô∏è‚É£ Applying FAIR Data Principles

The Onto4reuse framework aims to support software engineers in designing robust software for real-world applications, including infrastructure asset management and modular building construction.

Check out the research to explore how Onto4Reuse bridges the gap between theory and practice, driving progress in ontology-driven software systems. The paper is available [here](https://lnkd.in/ePEuj8PV).

The paper has been presented in the 13th International Workshop on Formal Ontologies Meet Industry (FOMI), co-located with 14th edition of the International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS 2024), which was excellently organised by the Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group at the University of Twente.

This research was carried out in collaboration with Pieter Pauwels Alex Donkers from Eindhoven University of Technology and Esra Bektas Tim van Ee from TNO.
