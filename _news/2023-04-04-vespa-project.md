---

After 8 years of service, Prof. Dr. Paul Klint (honorary VERSEN fellow) stepped down from the board of the Advisory Council on IT Assessment (AcICT, https://www.adviescollegeicttoetsing.nl/). He is succeeded by Prof. Dr. Arie van Deursen (Technical University Delft) and Prof. Dr. Joost Visser (Leiden University). The council advises the Dutch cabinet, parliament and senate on risks and chances of success of Information Technology projects. We thank Paul Klint for his service and his efforts to improve the quality of and the awareness about software engineering in government projects. We are confident that Van Deursen and Visser will be worthy successors, and wish them the best of luck!
