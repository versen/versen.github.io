As in the previous editions of ICT.Open, there will be a dedicated Software Engineering track at ICT.Open 2025 on 15-16 April 2025 at the Beatrix Theater Jaarbeurs Utrecht.

The Track on Software Engineering provides researchers and practitioners with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences on the development and evolution of software-intensive systems. The goal is to bring the wider software engineering community together to share inspiring visions for the future of software engineering and software (eco-)systems. The forum provides an opportunity to discuss promising developments stemming from recent innovations, promising research, and new theoretical foundations.  

Program of the track:

- 11:00 - 11:30 Invited talk:  Software for the Planet: Energy Efficiency and Large Language Models - Ivano Malavolta, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
- 11:30 - 11:40 Oral presentation: Validation of supervisory control synthesis tool CIF using model checker mCRL2 - Michel Reniers, TU Eindhoven
