title: "NWA Grant for DESTRESS: Building a Privacy-Preserving Stress Resilience Platform"
---
 
The DESTRESS NWA consortium is currently voting on adding Utrecht University as a partner, which leads to funding of around 750k euro. Utrecht University will lead the software engineering of a privacy-preserving software platform for organizational and individual stress resilience.

To realize this, we are hiring a PhD student and a postdoctoral researcher to co-develop the platform, supported by a research software engineer and student project teams. Together, they will create a scalable ecosystem for early stress detection and resilience, in collaboration with a wide consortium of academic and societal partners. The main academic challenge will be to create an open ecosystem in which end-user data is protected and safe from abuse.
