As of October 15th, two new colleagues have joined the Information Technology group at Wageningen University & Research as Assistant Professors. [June Sallou](https://june.sallou.org/) and [Siamak Farshidi](https://siamakfarshidi.nl/) bring valuable expertise in Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Generative AI, strengthening our research and teaching efforts in these dynamic fields.

We are also pleased to announce the introduction of two new courses: Generative AI and Natural Language Processing. These additions build on our pioneering work at Wageningen University, where we have previously introduced foundational courses in Big Data, Data Science Concepts, Linked Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Intelligence for Food and Health.

In addition, we have started a Digital Twins Lab to support our research in smart systems, providing new opportunities for innovation and experimentation in this exciting area. Each year, our group educates around 3,000 students across more than 30 courses, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to excel in technology and data-driven fields.
