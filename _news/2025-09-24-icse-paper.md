---

We are excited to announce that a paper by the Software and Sustainability research group and colleagues has been accepted at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026), the premier conference in software engineering!

**Title: Generating Energy-Efficient Code via Large-Language Models -- Where are we now?**

**Authors:** Radu Apsan, Vincenzo Stoico, Michel Albonico, Rudra Dhar, Karthik Vaidhyanathan, and Ivano Malavolta.

💡 Key Findings

- 🟢 Human expert code remains **the most energy-efficient**, outperforming all LLM-generated code by **17% to 30%**.
- 🤖 **LLMs outperform average human developers** on some platforms, but still lag behind green-expert solutions.  
- ⚙️ **Prompt engineering does not consistently improve energy efficiency**. 
- 🌩️ **Human expertise is still crucial** for developing energy-efficient Python code.
