At the CompSys 2025 conference, held in conjunction with the Netherlands Conference on Computer Vision (NCCV 2025), Dr. Stijn Heldens received the Best ASCI PhD Thesis Award 2024 for his dissertation titled "Parallel Programming Systems for Scalable Scientific Computing." His thesis was selected as the most outstanding among all PhD dissertations completed in 2024 within the ASCI research school.

The Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI) is the national Dutch research school dedicated to excellence in computer systems and imaging. It brings together nearly all computer science departments across Dutch universities to foster high-quality research and graduate education.

Stijn Heldens’ dissertation addresses the increasing complexity of high-performance computing (HPC) systems and the challenges this poses for scientific researchers. It presents scalable programming solutions that work effectively across a range of platforms—from personal desktops to exascale supercomputers. Stijn completed his PhD at the University of Amsterdam and the Netherlands eScience Center, where he continues to work as a Research Software Engineer (RSE). His research was supervised by Prof. Dr. Rob van Nieuwpoort (promotor), with Dr. Jason Maasen and Dr. Ben van Werkhoven serving as co-promotors.
