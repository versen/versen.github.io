title: "Symposium - Cybersecurity and Trust in Software Ecosystems (May 14th 2025)"
---

Join us for an engaging symposium exploring the future of trust in global software ecosystems. Inspired by Fang Hou’s PhD thesis, this event delves into how empirical software engineering can help rebuild and reinforce trust across interconnected software platforms. We’ll present the TrustSECO infrastructure, which uses distributed ledger technologies and AI-enhanced evaluations to empower developers, organizations, and users to make informed decisions. With the rising stakes of software reliability and security, this symposium offers cutting-edge insights, practical tools, and a vision for a more resilient digital society. Ideal for researchers, developers, policy-makers, and platform stewards.
