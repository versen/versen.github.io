title: "Best Paper Award for Testing Railway Controllers"
---

On 20 September 2023, during the 28th Conference on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS'23), Djurre van der Wal (PhD), Marcus Gerhold (Assistant Prof), and MariÃ«lle Stoelinga (Prof) from the University of Twente were presented with the Best Paper Award for their paper "_Conformance in the Railway Industry: Single-Input-Change Testing a EULYNX Controller_". 

In the paper, a model-based test approach is applied that (i) is automated; (ii) is restricted to tests that can be applied efficiently in practice; (iii) produces test suites of a manageable size that achieve a meaningful type of coverage; and (iv) improves fault coverage relative to earlier work.
