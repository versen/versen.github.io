title: "Find2Fix reduces software errors using transparent AI"
---

The Find2Fix project received funding from NWO through the Knowledge and Innovation Convenant (KIC) on cybersecurity for digital resilience. Find2Fix is a collaboration between researchers from TU Delft (Sicco Verwer, Sebastijan Dumancic, and Annibale Panichella) and Radboud University Nijmegen (Mairielli Wessel, Erik Poll, and Frits Vaandrager), and industrial partners DCODIS and ASML, focussed on reducing software errors using transparent AI. 

The team will build the first open-source Find2Fix pipeline, focused on explaining the root cause of an error and why a suggested fix works. 

The aim is to explain errors and fixes to developers without requiring extensive security knowledge, publish the pipeline as open source, and build a Dutch start-up that makes it easy to use and brings it to market. With this effort, they aim to increase our digital autonomy.
