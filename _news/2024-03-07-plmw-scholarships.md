The application for attending the Programming Language Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) @PLDI 2024 is open. 
The deadline is March 25th AOE for full consideration but we'll continue on a rolling basis after that as long as we have funding. 
The application link is [here](https://forms.gle/2haU1bMM7UKxU39y8). 

Please encourage undergraduates, MS students, and junior PhD students that you think could benefit from the workshop to apply. 
Below is more information about PLMW@PLDI 2024.

PLMW aims to broaden the exposure of late-stage undergraduate students and early-stage graduate students to research and career opportunities in programming languages. 
The workshop includes mentoring sessions that cover effective habits for navigating research careers, technical sessions that cover core subfields of programming languages research, and social sessions that create opportunities for students to interact with researchers in the field. Applications from underrepresented groups in computing are especially welcome.
PLMW @ PLDI 2024 will be co-located with the conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation. It will be held on June 24-25, 2024, Copenhagen, Denmark. 

The workshop program will cover important topics such as:
- Career paths after graduate school
- Interplay between PL and other areas of research in Computer Science
- Useful research skills such as giving good talks and writing papers
- Overview of key PL research areas both in academia and industry
