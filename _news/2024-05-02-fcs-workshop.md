title: "Call for papers: FCS workshop @ CSFâ€™24"
---

The Workshop on *Foundations of Computer Security (FCS)*, is co-located with CSF in Enschede, The Netherlands on July 8, 2024.  FCS is a friendly, in-person 1-day workshop that brings together researchers interested in laying the foundations of secure systems.

FCS welcomes papers on all topics related to the formal underpinnings of security and privacy, and their applications. The workshop has no formal proceedings: you are welcome to advertise work that appeared in other venues or submit your work-in-progress. We are seeking submissions for full-length talks and short talks.  Submissions may conform to any 2-column format accepted by IEEE, ACM, or USENIX conferences. FCS uses a light form of double-blind reviewing similar to CSF.

Submissions are due **May 13, 2024 (AoE)**.
