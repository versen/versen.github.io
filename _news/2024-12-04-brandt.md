This September, [Dr. Carolin Brandt](https://carolin-brandt.de/) has started as an Assistant Professor at the Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) at TU Delft. She leads the research line on [Human- and Developer-centered Software Engineering](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/research-lines/human-and-developer-centered-se/) and investigates how to build automation tools that are better for the developers that create and use them. While focusing on testing currently, she is also looking for collaborations in other areas of software engineering that could benefit from a closer look at human aspects and the users' reality.

Currently, Carolin is also looking for a PhD student to join her work on Developer-centred Just-in-Time Test Generation. [vacancy details](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/vacancies/dev-centered-test-gen)
