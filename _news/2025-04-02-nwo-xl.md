The project "Cyclic Structures in Programs and Proofs: New Harmonies in Software Correctness by Construction" will receive 3 million euros from NWO to perform groundbreaking research in software reliability, pushing the boundaries across areas such as Logic, Programming Languages, Concurrency, and Proof Assistants.

This XL grant will fund a consortium led by Jorge Pérez (Groningen) working together with Bahareh Afshari (Gothenburg), Henning Basold (Leiden), Marcello Bonsangue (Leiden), Georgiana Caltais (Twente), Jesper Cockx (Delft), Helle Hvid Hansen (Groningen), and Robbert Krebbers (Nijmegen). 

Nine research positions (PhD students and postdocs) will be soon advertised—stay tuned!
