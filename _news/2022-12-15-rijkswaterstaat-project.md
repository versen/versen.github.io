title: "Modelling and verification of software building blocks in the infrastructure of Rijkswaterstaat"
---

Rijkswaterstaat recently decided to fund a PhD position to model and verify building blocks of critical Dutch infrastructure. In particular the goal is to verify the complete set of software building blocks in Dutch tunnels, and to develop a specification methodology that can be used by Rijkswaterstaat and its suppliers to precisely describe the behaviour of the building blocks such that verification can be done automatically.

The project will take place under supervision of [prof.dr.ir. J.F. Groote](https://www.win.tue.nl/~jfg/).

Per September 15, 2022, ir. Kevin Jilissen started as the PhD student on this project.
