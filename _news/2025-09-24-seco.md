---
 
Utrecht University has received an NWO Take-off Phase 1 grant for the project SearchSECO: Finding Vulnerabilities in the Worldwide Software Ecosystem. The project explores the feasibility of a method-level software search engine that enables fine-grained vulnerability detection, software provenance tracking, and AI-driven security analysis. This study will help assess the technical and commercial potential of SearchSECO and lay the foundation for a future spin-off company.
