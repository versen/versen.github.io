Hello! I'm Vincenzo Stoico, an Assistant Professor in the [Software and Sustainability](https://s2group.cs.vu.nl/) (S2) group at VU Amsterdam. My research focuses on making software systems more energy-efficient and high-performing, especially in resource-intensive domains like AI and scientific computing. I use empirical methods to develop strategies to reduce the environmental impact of software, both by improving performance and by creating tools to measure and mitigate energy usage.
Before joining VU Amsterdam as faculty in May, I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher in the same group. I earned my PhD from the University of L'Aquila, where I specialized in software modeling and performance analysis, with a focus on techniques for refactoring software models to enhance efficiency.

Beyond research, I’m committed to raising awareness among students and practitioners about the environmental footprint of software systems. I’m also excited to be part of Amsterdam’s vibrant, culturally rich community, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating with many of you!
