Do you have a mathematics or computer science research topic that deserves broader attention? Would you like to organize more collaboration within the Dutch scientific community?

A CWI Research Semester Programme might be just the opportunity that you are looking for! The programmes are unique in creating time and space to collaborate with colleagues on a topic of relevance to the Dutch mathematics and computer science communities. You can propose an idea for a coherent set of activities; CWI provides the organizing support staff, PR and a budget for meeting facilities, travel and accommodation.

Interested? You can submit proposals for a CWI Research Semester Programme in 2027/2028 now.

The call for proposals closes June 16th 2025.
