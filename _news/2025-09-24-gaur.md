Hello! I'm Shaurya Gaur, a new PhD candidate in the Software and Sustainability (S2) and Learning and Reasoning (L&R) groups at VU Amsterdam. My research will focus on software architectures for human-centric AI systems, supervised by Dr. Justus Bogner (S2) and Dr. Filip Ilievski (L&R). Previously, I earned my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University in Nijmegen. Last year, I worked at RadboudUMC to evaluate the bias and fairness of deep learning models for predicting the risk of lung cancer in a chest CT. There, I learned how difficult it is to apply ethical AI theories in software practice. That's why here at VU, I aim to bridge this gap, investigating how to use software architecture to aid AI practitioners in managing explainability, adaptability and other attributes. In my free time, I'm excited to explore historical places, bouldering gyms and cinemas in the vibrant Amsterdam area. Looking forward to connecting with you!
