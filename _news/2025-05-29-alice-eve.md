We are delighted to announce that the next Alice & Eve event, celebrating Women in Computing, will take place on October 31 2025 in Groningen. We warmly invite everyone—of all genders, ages, and disciplines—to join us in Groningen.

For more details, please visit [this website](https://alice-and-eve.github.io/2025/).

Inspired by the Lovelace Colloquium (initiated by the University of Twente), this 6th edition of Alice & Eve will feature:
- An exhibition highlighting thirty women in computing and their contributions
- A diverse lineup of speakers
- Poster competition

Additionally, the organizing committee has established a Women in Computing Groningen Groningen group to foster a strong, long-term community in the North Netherlands. Our vision is to build a supportive network that promotes inclusivity and equity in computing. You are cordially invited to sign up to [this LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13184072/).

Please feel free to distribute this announcement within your networks. We look forward to celebrating with you!
