The paper "_Generating Customised Control Flow Graphs for Legacy Languages with Semi-Parsing_" was written as a result of collaboration between a Dutch academic researcher from UTwente, a Belgian compiler services provider Raincode Labs and a Belgian university UCL.

They brought together their expertise in (semi)parsing and in software analytics, to help migration engineers from the industrial partner to demonstrate behaviour preservation when refactoring large quantities of COBOL code with embedded SQL.

The paper received the Best Artefact Award from ICSME, one of the two top conferences in the field of software evolution. The artefact is available publicly [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6806075).
