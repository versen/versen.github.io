The IFIP Working Group 10.4 has selected the following paper as winner of the Jean-Claude Laprie Award in Dependable Computing:

Christel Baier, Boudewijn Haverkort, Holger Hermanns, & Joost-Pieter Katoen, __Model-checking algorithms for continuous-time Markov chains__, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, June 2003, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2003.1205180.

"This paper presents a unifying theory and algorithm to evaluate a wide variety of performance and dependability measures for continuous-time Markov chain models. The proposed approach inspired many researchers and provided a theoretical foundation for various model-checking tools, including GreatSPN, PRISM, STORM, and COMPASS. Techniques first presented in the paper are being used in real-life, industrial applications of dependable and mission-critical systems, e.g., at the European Space Agency (ESA), the approach has been used for evaluating space system dependability and at BMW, the approach has been applied for evaluating designs of autonomous driving systems architectures."

The Jean-Claude Laprie Award in Dependable Computing is awarded annually since 2012 by the IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance in his honour. The award recognises outstanding papers that have significantly influenced the theory and/or practice of Dependable Computing.
