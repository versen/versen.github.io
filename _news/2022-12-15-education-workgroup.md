title: "VERSEN workgroup on Education"
---

In October 2021, we started with the VERSEN workgroup on Education to bring together researchers and teachers of software engineering courses in the Netherlands. The goal of this workgroup is to improve education, to foster collaboration, for example by sharing best-practices, and to make an inventory of SE-related courses that are part of CS curricula across the country. We participated in a panel discussion at the 2022 SEN symposium, where we pitched statements about the current state of software engineering education.

The workgroup identified three directions to focus on for the near future. First, we are compiling an overview of all Software Engineering courses in bachelor and master programmes offered by universities in the Netherlands, and compare this with the latest Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Second, we plan to organize seminars about teaching and organizing courses on a particular topic, such as the bachelor-level, capstone software project, and to facilitate sharing experiences and ideas. Third, we search for signature courses, which could eventually lead to a VERSEN programme (e.g. a minor).

__The workgroup is welcoming members of the Software Engineering community to join and contribute to the workgroup's activities__. The workgroup is an excellent opportunity for extending your professional network, particularly (but not exclusively) for junior staff members. Most meetings are online or hybrid. For further information, please see the webpage of the workgroup ([https://www.versen.nl/contents/works/education](https://www.versen.nl/contents/works/education)) or contact [Bastiaan Heeren](https://www.ou.nl/web/open-universiteit/zoek-medewerker#!user/bhr) (Open University, chair).
