The yearly [Ubuntu Summit](https://events.canonical.com/event/51/page/334-about-the-summit) this year will be hosted in The Hague. The Ubuntu Summit brings together some of the most exciting organisations and projects driving open source innovation. 

Talks at the event will cover everything from how DreamWorks Animation orchestrates massive workloads for feature films, to reaching for a better future with Rust, and even revolutionising train system toilets with embedded technologies. We’ll have booths from Framework, Fairphone, Microsoft, Intel, and more – including one dedicated to gaming on Linux, and another to the world’s first RISC-V laptop. 

There's no registration cost for the event, and we think it might be a great opportunity for your members and their students to hear about some very interesting projects in open source software.
