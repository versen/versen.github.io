At ICT.OPEN 2025, on 16 April, the winners of the VERSEN PhD awards 2024 were announced. This year, the committee received very strong and impressive theses, making it a very enjoyable experience to read about the great research being done in the Dutch SE community, but also making it very hard to select the winners.

Nevertheless, in the end, the following winners were identified:

- FIRST PLACE: Guarantees by Construction, by **Jules Jacobs** (Radboud University)
- SECOND PLACE: Correctly Communicating Software: Distributed, Asynchronous and Beyond, by **Bas van den Heuvel** (University of Groningen)
- THIRD PLACE: Fine-Grained Analysis of Software Supply Chains, by **Joseph Hejderup** (Delft University of Technology)

The VERSEN PhD awards 2024 are sponsored by ASML: the first place winner receives 500 euros, the second place winner receives 250 euros, and the third place winner receives 125 euros.

Congratulations to the winners!
