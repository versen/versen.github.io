title: "Fix-IT: Improving Gender Equality in the IT Sector"
---

The Dutch IT sector faces a significant challenge: a tight labor market exacerbated by the underrepresentation of women in IT education and jobs. This issue not only has societal implications, such as unequal opportunities for women, but also economic consequences due to the underutilization of valuable labor market potential.

To address this "leaky pipeline, NHL Stenden UAS and Windesheim UAS, in collaboration with Connect.frl and software companies Snakeware and DLA-ICT, are launching an innovative research project funded by the European ESF+ program. This initiative aims to increase the enrollment and retention of female students in higher education IT programs and to enhance their career opportunities in the IT sector and other STEM fields.

At the heart of this project is research into the factors contributing to the underrepresentation of women in IT. By leveraging existing knowledge and insights, we will improve an existing intervention toolbox aimed at enhancing the learning and working environment for women in IT. This research will not only lead to concrete tools for educational institutions and companies but also provide a better understanding of the barriers women face in their IT careers.
