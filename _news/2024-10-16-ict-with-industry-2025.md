From 20-24 January, NWO and Lorentz Center are organizing ICT with Industry 2025. The workshop brings IT and Computer Science researchers together with professional organizations. During one week, you will be able to work on a case study, as part of a team.

ICT with Industry 2025 will revolve around four case studies, which have been contributed by the following organizations: 
* Alliander: Data Driven Approach towards More Efficient Newton-Raphson Power Flow Calculation for Distribution Grids.
* Contractuo: How to change a trained transformerâ€™s mind
* ING: How could AI facilitate the engineering work on software refactoring?
* ING: How could AI help on understanding legacy software?

This is a great opportunity for young Computer Scientists in the Netherlands. If you are interested in tackling scientific challenges proposed by professional organizations, you can find more info and register through the web site: [https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/ictwi2025](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/ictwi2025)

Note: The SIKS, IPA and ASCI research schools provide credits for PhD students participating in the workshop. At the end of the workshop NWO will issue a letter of attendance upon request.
