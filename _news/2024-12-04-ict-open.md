SIG VERSEN is organising the Software Engineering Track at ICT.Open 2025, to take place on 15-16 April 2025 at the Beatrix Theater Jaarbeurs Utrecht.

This track highlights the importance of interdisciplinary discussions to push the boundaries of how software impacts industries and communities worldwide. Topics of interest centre around the development of reliable, sustainable and ethical software, among others. This year we will host a keynote presentation bridging the history and future of software engineering, posters, presentations and demos.
