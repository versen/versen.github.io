title: "Invitation to Workshop on Industry Perspectives on Research Software Quality"
---

The EVERSE consortium would like to invite you to participate in a focused workshop exploring the intersection of research software quality and industry practices. This 90-minute virtual session will take place on 12 June from 10:30 - 12:00 UK / 11:30 - 13:00 CET.

**Why Your Perspective Matters**
As someone with industry experience, your insights are important as we develop frameworks and best practices for research software quality. This can range from the quality of the code itself, to the quality of the development practices, and quality of deployment that affects users, as well as indicators and metrics to measure quality. This workshop specifically aims to bridge the gap between academic research software development and industry software engineering practices.

**What's in it for You?**

- Network with peers from both research and industry sectors
- Shape quality frameworks that could influence future skills development and software assessment
- Exchange knowledge on effective quality assessment approaches that might benefit your recruitment and development processes
- A summary of the ideas discussed during the event will be shared with all participants

**Workshop Format**

The workshop will be structured with facilitated discussion:
- Brief introduction to EVERSE's framework and tools for research software quality
- Guided discussion sessions designed to capture your input
- Open discussion and Q&A to address any additional points

No preparation is needed on your part - we value your spontaneous insights and professional experience.

The entire session will last approximately 90 minutes.

**Background**

EVERSE is a European Commission-funded research project, which aims to develop a framework for research software quality. As part of this work, we're exploring how industry perspectives and practices can inform our approach, especially where research and commercial interests overlap.

**Registration Process**
