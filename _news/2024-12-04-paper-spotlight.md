This is the very first book to focus on diversity and inclusion in software development teams. It is open access, which means that you have free and unlimited access. The book comprises 29 chapters reviewing scientific evidence from studies of EDI barriers, impacts, and a research agenda for further work, as well as showing what can be done to increase diversity as well as current best practices.
