title: "Hack4Her: Female-focused student hackathon at Vrije Universiteit in June"
---

Hack4Her creates a safe space where technology and diversity meet. We are a coalition of staff and students from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Universiteit van Amsterdam. Our mission is simple: to create a women-centered space in the tech world.

We welcome BSc or MSc female students studying at any Dutch University, so long as they participate in the hacking. For traveling students we offer, among other things, free accommodation (rooms of 3-4 co-hackers) for the duration of the event nearby the VU campus. But it's first-come-first-serve and the spots are limited!

Do you know any female students that may be interested? Encourage them to register to the event!
