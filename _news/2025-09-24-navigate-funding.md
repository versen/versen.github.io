**Keynote** - Marieke Huisman What you need to know about NWO, before you start writing your project application
In this presentation, I will give my view on what you can do to increase your chances of success when submitting proposals to NWO. The presentation will be based on my own experiences, both as proposal writer and as NWO panel member.

**Keynote** - Paris Avgeriou. ‚ÄúShow me the money!‚Äù, said the promotion committee to the tenure-tracker:
Research funding is an indispensable part of academic life and often the bane of tenure-trackers‚Äô existence. The scope of this talk covers European-level, collaborative research projects through both Horizon programs, as well as ITEA which is rather popular in Software Engineering research. I will discuss my own meandering path towards obtaining grants and share some tips and pitfalls along the way.
