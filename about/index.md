## About SEN Symposium

This is the first national symposium for Dutch researchers in the field of _Software Engineering_. 
The goal is to provide a forum bringing all of us researchers in this broad field together, 
with exchange of research results and new research directions 
and a more effective professional network as a result. 

### Software Engineering 

From an industrial perspective: software engineering is the art of building and maintaining high quality software 
in an efficient manner. This entails knowledge, skill and technology for managing not only the source code but also people 
and organization. The research field of software engineering is similarly multi-faceted. The research community in The Netherlands
studies all aspects of software engineering from all possible angles: programming, design and architecture, process, testing, and uses 
a plethora of research methods to accomplish results: formal methods, design studies, experiments, analytics, data mining.
Due to the nature of software it is natural for academic results in software engineering to transfer with ease to their application in an industrial context. It is also urgent that this research and its transfer is happening: we as a society need to be able to better understand and manipulate software, because software is influencing our way of living in very profound manners. Think privacy and information security, think multi-million budget overruns, and think software which supports business flexibility and product innovation rather than preventing it.

### Organization

The SEN symposium is organized by [CWI](http://www.cwi.nl). CWI is the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands and is an institute of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research ([NWO](http://www.nwo.nl)).
