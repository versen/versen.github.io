# A Language Designer’s Workbench

Domain-specific languages can help reduce the accidental complexity of
software by capturing and encapsulating the knowledge about computing in a
domain. Traditional approaches to implementation of software languages
require a language designer to encode the syntax and semantics of a
language in multiple formats to cater for the construction of artifacts
such as interpreters, compilers, IDEs, and correctness proofs.

The objective of my VICI project is to create a language designer’s
workbench that supports the design of new software languages using
high-level declarative meta-languages that allow the construction multiple
artifacts from a single source. In this talk, I will sketch the vision of
the project and report on our progress. In particular, I will discuss our
work on declarative specification of name binding and operational semantics.
