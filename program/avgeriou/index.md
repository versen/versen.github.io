# Technical Debt: looking for new solutions for an old problem

The term Technical Debt became popular in 1992, when Ward Cunningham
tried to introduce a metaphor that expresses immature software artifacts
that fail to meet the required level of quality. More generally, it
reflects technical compromises that can yield short-term benefits but
may hurt the long-term health of a software system.Technical Debt has
since been recognized by the industry as a major issue in software
engineering, while the research community has spent substantial effort
in trying to define ways to tackle it. The inevitable hype has resulted
in a proliferation of approaches to deal with Technical Debt at the
level of code, design, architecture, requirements, testing etc. In this
context we revisit the state of the art to examine how much progress is
achieved so far, and we discuss some promising future directions in the
field.
